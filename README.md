***SPACEMAN***

**Rules of the game**:
	1. Player must guess a word
	2. There will be 10 "HINTS" on display
	3. If player has 6 wrong guess - game over!

**Spaceman will begin to appear as player gets guesses wrong**:
	1. First wrong guess = Head of Spaceman
	2. Second wrong guess = Head & Torso of Spaceman
	3. Third wrong guess = Head, Toros & 1 Arm of Spaceman
	4. Fourth wrong guess = Head, Torso & 2 Arms of Spaceman
	5. Fifth wrong guess = Head, Torso & 2 Arms plus 1 Leg of Spaceman

Player is looking to successfully guess 10 words and must spell correctly to complete the game. Must achieve this without getting the entire Spaceman to appear.
