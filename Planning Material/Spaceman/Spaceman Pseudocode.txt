Spaceman Pseudocode:

We are looking to discover the Map that is shaded out in the main background image. You will get 3 guesses per word that pops for you 
to fill in the blanks.

On top of the shaded image will be a box with an image that you can use as a hint to the word you must discover. You will also have a written hint at your disposal. The hints will cycle through simultaneously (image and content hints cycle together).

The hints will show for a total of 5 seconds and then move to the next. There will be a total of 3 different images and content hints. 

While you are being provided hints in the manner that is listed above you will need to enter a letter in the boxes provided. 

Top Page:
-> 2 boxes will appear
	Box 1 = Number of Hints
		Max 3 Hints per guessed word
	Box 2 = Collection of X's (with max 3 X's)

Pseudocode: Box 1 = 3 images that will show number of the hint being provided. Hint number 1 then hint number 2 and finally hint number 3.
		The hint numbers will cycle through every 5 seconds and repeat until that word is guessed correctly.
	    Box 2 = Shaded out "X"'s that will pop forward as the player enters a wrong letter.
		The player can only get 2 guess wrong because on the third wrong guess the final "X" will pop and the game is over.
